  <!-- THEOREM 1 -->
  <h3>Theorem 1: Vertically Opposite Angles</h3>
  <p>When two lines cross, the angles opposite each other are equal.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If ∠AOC = 65°, then ∠BOD = 65°.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 2 -->
  <h3>Theorem 2: Base Angles of an Isosceles Triangle</h3>
  <p>In an isosceles triangle the angles opposite the equal sides are equal.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB = AC and ∠B = 50°, then ∠C = 50°.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 3 -->
  <h3>Theorem 3: Parallel Lines &amp; Alternate Angles</h3>
  <p>If a transversal makes equal alternate angles on two lines, the lines are parallel—and conversely.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If alternate angles are 120°, the two lines cannot meet—so they’re parallel.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 4 -->
  <h3>Theorem 4: Angles in a Triangle Sum to 180°</h3>
  <p>The three interior angles of any triangle add to 180°.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If ∠A = 70° and ∠B = 50°, then ∠C = 60°.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 5 -->
  <h3>Theorem 5: Parallel Lines &amp; Corresponding Angles</h3>
  <p>Two lines are parallel if, for any transversal, the corresponding angles are equal.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Corresponding angles of 75° imply the lines never meet, so they’re parallel.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 6 -->
  <h3>Theorem 6: Exterior Angle of a Triangle</h3>
  <p>Each exterior angle equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If ∠A=40° and ∠B=60°, then exterior ∠ACD = 100°.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 7 -->
  <h3>Theorem 7: Larger Side, Larger Angle</h3>
  <p>The angle opposite the greater of two sides is greater than the angle opposite the lesser side.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> AB=8, AC=5 ⇒ ∠C>∠B (e.g. 60°>40°).</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 8 -->
  <h3>Theorem 8: Triangle Inequality</h3>
  <p>The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB=4, BC=5, CA=8 → 4+5=9>8, etc., so valid.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 9 -->
  <h3>Theorem 9: Parallelogram Opposites</h3>
  <p>In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and opposite angles are equal.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB=6 and BC=4, then CD=6, DA=4, and ∠A=∠C.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 10 -->
  <h3>Theorem 10: Diagonals of a Parallelogram</h3>
  <p>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AC=10, BD=8, then AO=OC=5 and BO=OD=4.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 11 -->
  <h3>Theorem 11: Equal Segments by Parallel Lines</h3>
  <p>If three (or more) parallel lines cut equal segments on one transversal, they cut equal segments on any transversal.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> l₁,l₂,l₃ cut AB into 2 units each ⇒ also cut EF into 2-unit segments.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 12 -->
  <h3>Theorem 12: Parallel Line in Triangle</h3>
  <p>A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other sides proportionally.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AD=3, DB=6, then AE/EC = 3/6 = ½.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 13 -->
  <h3>Theorem 13: Similar Triangles</h3>
  <p>If two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB=4, BC=6, DE=2, EF=3 ⇒ 4/2=6/3=2.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 14 -->
  <h3>Theorem 14: Pythagoras’ Theorem</h3>
  <p>In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides: c² = a² + b².</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB=3, BC=4 ⇒ AC = 5 since 3²+4²=9+16=25.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 15 -->
  <h3>Theorem 15: Converse of Pythagoras</h3>
  <p>If in a triangle c² = a² + b², then the triangle is right-angled opposite side c.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sides 6, 8, 10 ⇒ 10² = 6²+8² ⇒ right angle opposite 10.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 16 -->
  <h3>Theorem 16: Triangle Area Independence</h3>
  <p>The area formula ½·base·height gives the same result regardless of which side is chosen as the base.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Δ with BC=10,h₁=6 ⇒ area=30; also CA=8,h₂=7.5 ⇒ ½·8·7.5=30.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 17 -->
  <h3>Theorem 17: Parallelogram Diagonal Bisects Area</h3>
  <p>A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two equal-area triangles.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Parallelogram with base 8, height 5 ⇒ total area=40; each triangle=20.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 18 -->
  <h3>Theorem 18: Area of a Parallelogram</h3>
  <p>The area equals base times height: Area = b·h.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Base=12, height=4 ⇒ area=48.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 19 -->
  <h3>Theorem 19: Angles in a Circle</h3>
  <p>The angle at the centre of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference on the same arc.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If ∠ABC=30°, then ∠AOC=60°.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 20 -->
  <h3>Theorem 20: Tangent-Radius Perpendicularity</h3>
  <p>Each tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact; conversely, a line perpendicular to a radius at its endpoint on the circle is a tangent.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> OP=5, PT ⟂ OP ⇒ PT is a tangent.</p>

  <hr>

  <!-- THEOREM 21 -->
  <h3>Theorem 21: Chord-Perpendicular Bisector</h3>
  <p>The perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord; conversely, the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If AB=10 and OQ ⟂ AB at Q, then AQ=QB=5.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Corollaries</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Equilateral Triangle:</strong> all sides and angles are equal (each 60°).  
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Side 5 ⇒ all angles 60°.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chord Equidistance:</strong> chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length.  
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If both chords are 3 cm from centre, they’re congruent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Angles in Same Segment:</strong> angles standing on the same chord are equal.  
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Both angles measure 45°.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cyclic Quadrilateral:</strong> opposite angles sum to 180°.  
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If ∠A=110°, then ∠C=70°.</p>
    </li>

## Enlargements (Similarity and Scale)

**Definition:**  
An *enlargement* (also called a dilation or scaling) is a transformation that changes the size of a figure but not its shape. The image is enlarged or reduced by a *scale factor* from a fixed point called the *center of enlargement*.

**Key Properties:**
- Corresponding angles remain equal.
- Corresponding sides are in the same ratio (the scale factor).
- If the scale factor is greater than 1, the figure is enlarged.  
  If between 0 and 1, the figure is reduced.

**Example:**  
If triangle ABC is enlarged by a scale factor of 2 about point O, then every point moves away from O so that its distance from O is doubled.


**Formula:**  
If the original length is *L* and the scale factor is *k*,  
then the new length is *kL*.
